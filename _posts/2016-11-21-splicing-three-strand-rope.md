My sudden interest in rope splicing stems entirely from bell ropes. There seems to be three, perhaps four, splices to learn for this application. Links below to YouTube videos explaining how to do them:

* [Eye Splice](https://youtu.be/QeYBkMCQ8WY)
* [Short Splice](https://youtu.be/PFFeDH2u7E0)
* [Long Splice](https://youtu.be/sN-cnO8Fqrc)
* [End/Back Splice](https://youtu.be/bRjqMKLS99A)

Above the sally you’d probably use a long splice as it’s thinner than the short splice for running over any pulleys. Below the sally, either a short splice to the tail end if it doesn’t see much wear, or an eye splice if the tail end is changed frequently, typical on larger bells. The back splice could be used on the top end to give a nice finish to the rope.

I’m amazed how straightforward they are to do and how strong they are given that it’s just an over-under weave of strands without a knot in sight!
