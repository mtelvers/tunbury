My Apple Watch has a cool watch face which shows the position of the sun, which feels like a good application for my [GPIO library](https://github.com/mtelvers/gpio) and ePaper display.

I've published the code for the application and the solar position library at [mtelvers/solar](https://github.com/mtelvers/solar)
