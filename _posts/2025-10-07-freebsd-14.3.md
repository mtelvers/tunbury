The FreeBSD CI worker `rosemary` needs to be updated to FreeBSD 14.3.

The upgrade went without issue following the notes from last [time](https://www.tunbury.org/2025/03/26/freebsd-14.2/). [ocurrent/freebsd-infra](https://github.com/ocurrent/freebsd-infra) was updated with [PR#18](https://github.com/ocurrent/freebsd-infra/pull/18) and the base images were recreated with `ansible-playbook update.yml`.

[PR#1029](https://github.com/ocurrent/ocaml-ci/pull/1029) for OCaml CI and [PR#459](https://github.com/ocurrent/opam-repo-ci/pull/459) for opam-repo-ci were pushed to their respective live branches.
