Yesterday, we were talking about extending the current infrastructure database to incorporate other information to provide prompts to return machines to the pool of resources after they have completed their current role/loan, etc. There is also a wider requirement to bring these services back to Cambridge from Equinix/Scaleway, which will be the subject of a follow-up post. However, the idea of extending the database made me think that it would be amusing to overlay the machine's positions onto Google Maps.

I added positioning data in the Jekyll Collection `_machines\*.md` for each machine. e.g. [ainia.md](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/infrastructure/refs/heads/master/_machines/ainia.md)

```
---
name: ainia
...
latitude: 52.2109
longitude: 0.0917
---
```

Then Jekyll's Liquid templating engine can create a JavaScript array for us

```js
{% raw %}
  // Define machines data array from Jekyll collection
  const machinesData = [
    {% for machine in site.machines %}
      {% if machine.latitude and machine.longitude %}
      {
        name: "{{ machine.name }}",
        lat: {{ machine.latitude }},
        lng: {{ machine.longitude }},
        {% if machine.description %}
        description: "{{ machine.description | escape }}",
        {% endif %}
        // Add any other properties you need
      },
      {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
  ];
{% endraw %}
```

This array can be converted into an array of map markers. Google have an API for clustering the markers into a count of machines. I added a random offset to each location to avoid all the markers piling up on a single spot.

The interactive map can be seen at [machines.html](https://infra.ocaml.org/machines.html)
