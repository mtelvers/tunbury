Brief notes on publishing a Jupyter notebook as a Docker container.

My starting point is a GitHub [repo](https://github.com/ucam-eo/tessera-interactive-map) containing a Jupyter notebook and a `requirements.txt`.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ucam-eo/tessera-interactive-map
cd tessera-interactive-map
```

I created a `Dockerfile` which pulls in a standard Python container. I used 3.11 as that is the minimum version support for [https://github.com/ucam-eo/geotessera.git](https://github.com/ucam-eo/geotessera.git)

`pip` installs the packages listed in `requirements.txt` plus the additional [geotessera](https://github.com/ucam-eo/geotessera.git) library. The extra library is noted in the [README.md](https://github.com/ucam-eo/tessera-interactive-map/blob/main/README.md).

```sh
FROM python:3.11
WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
RUN pip install git+https://github.com/ucam-eo/geotessera.git
RUN pip install jupyter
EXPOSE 8888
ENV NAME World
CMD ["jupyter", "notebook", "--ip=0.0.0.0", "--port=8888", "--no-browser", "--allow-root"]
```

Build the Docker image.

```sh
docker build -t my-jupyter .
```

And run the container.

```sh
# docker run --rm -it -p 8888:8888 my-jupyter
