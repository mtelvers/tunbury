It's [Pi Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_Day) 2025

Archimedes calculated the perimeter of inscribed regular polygons
within a circle to approximate the value of π.

A square inscribed in a unit circle can be divided into four right
triangles with two sides of unit length, corresponding to the radius of
the circle.  The third side can be calculated by Pythagoras' theorem to
be √2.  The perimeter of the square would be 4√2.  Given, C=πd, we
can calculate π from the circumference by dividing it by the diameter,
2, giving 2√2.

CA, CD and CB are all the unit radius. AB is √2 as calculated above. The
angle ACB can be bisected with the line CD. EB is half of AB. Using
Pythagoras' theorem on the triangle BCE we can calculated CE. DE is then
1 - CE, allowing us to use Pythagoras' theorem for a final time on BDE to
calculated BD. The improved approximation of the perimeter is now 8 x BD.

We can iterate on this process using the following code:

```ocaml
let rec pi edge_squared sides = function
  | 0 -> sides *. Float.sqrt(edge_squared) /. 2.
  | n ->
    let edge_squared = 2. -. 2. *. Float.sqrt (1. -. edge_squared /. 4.) in
    let sides = sides *. 2. in
    pi edge_squared sides (n - 1)

let approximation = pi 2. 4. 13
let () = Printf.printf "pi %.31f\n" approximation
```

I found this method quite interesting. Usually, as the number of
iterations increases the approximation of π becomes more accurate
with the delta between each step becoming smaller until the difference
is effectively zero (given the limited precision of the floating
calculation).  However, in this case, after 13 iterations the
approximation becomes worse!

Using the [decimal](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/decimal/) package
we can specify the floating point precision we want allowing us to
get to 100 decimal places in 165 steps.

```ocaml
open Decimal

let context = Context.make ~prec:200 ()
let two = of_int 2
let four = of_int 4

let rec pi edge_squared sides n =
  match n with
  | 0 -> mul ~context sides (div ~context (sqrt ~context edge_squared) two)
  | n ->
      let edge_squared =
        sub ~context two
          (mul ~context two
             (sqrt ~context (sub ~context one (div ~context edge_squared four))))
      in
      let sides = mul ~context sides two in
      pi edge_squared sides (Int.pred n)

let () = pi two four 165 |> to_string ~context |> Printf.printf "%s\n"
```
