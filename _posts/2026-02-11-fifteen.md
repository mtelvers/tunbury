Numberphile's latest [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UafhPUOCM1E) has been released, and in it Ben Sparks introduces the 15 Game.

Two players take turns choosing tiles numbered 1–9 from a shared pool. The first player to collect exactly three tiles that sum to 15 wins. If all tiles are taken with no winner, the game is a draw.

This looks like a great project for a [js_of_ocaml](https://ocaml.org/p/js_of_ocaml/latest/doc/js_of_ocaml/Js_of_ocaml/Js/index.html) solution.

As the game maps directly onto tic-tac-toe, creating an AI player was straightforward. You can play my version from GitHub Pages [fifteen](https://mtelvers.github.io/fifteen).
