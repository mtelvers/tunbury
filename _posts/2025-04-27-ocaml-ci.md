As noted on Thursday, the various OCaml services will need to be moved away from Equinix. Below are my notes on moving OCaml-CI.

Generate an SSH key on the new server `chives` using `ssh-keygen -t ed25519`. Copy the public key to `c2-3.equinix.ci.dev` and save it under `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

Use `rsync` to mirror the Docker volumes. `-z` did improve performance as there appears to be a rate limiter somewhere in the path.

```sh
rsync -azvh --progress c2-3.equinix.ci.dev:/var/lib/docker/volumes/ /var/lib/docker/volumes/
```

After completing the copy, I waited for a quiet moment, and then scaled all of the Docker services to 0. I prefer to scale the services rather than remove them, as the recovery is much easier.

```sh
docker service scale infra_grafana=0
docker service scale infra_prometheus=0
docker service scale ocaml-ci_ci=0
docker service scale ocaml-ci_gitlab=0
docker service scale ocaml-ci_web=0
```

For the final copy, I used `--checksum` and also added `--delete`, as the Prometheus database creates segment files that are periodically merged into the main database.

```sh
rsync -azvh --checksum --delete --progress c2-3.equinix.ci.dev:/var/lib/docker/volumes/ /var/lib/docker/volumes/
```

The machine configuration is held in an Ansible Playbook, which includes the Docker stack for Grafana and Prometheus. It can be easily applied to the new machine:

```sh
ansible-playbook -e @secrets/ocaml.ci.dev.yml --vault-password-file secrets/vault-password ocaml.ci.dev.yml
```

OCaml-CIâ€™s Docker stack is held on GitHub [ocurrent/ocaml-ci](https://github.com/ocurrent/ocaml-ci) and can be deployed with:

```sh
make deploy-stack
```
