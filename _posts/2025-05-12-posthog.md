Sabine would like to switch [OCaml.org](https://ocaml.org) from using [Plausible](https://plausible.io) over to [Posthog](https://posthog.com). The underlying reason for the move is that the self-hosted product from Posthog has more features than the equivalent from Plausible. Of particular interest is the heatmap feature to assess the number of visitors who finish the [Tour of OCaml](https://ocaml.org/docs/tour-of-ocaml).

Posthog has [documentation](https://posthog.com/docs/self-host) on the self-hosted solution. In short, create a VM with 4 vCPU, 16GB RAM, and 30GB storage and run the setup script:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/posthog/posthog/HEAD/bin/deploy-hobby)‚Äù
```

Any subsequent upgrades can be achieved with:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/posthog/posthog/HEAD/bin/upgrade-hobby)"
```

After installation, I created a [public dashboard](https://posthog.ci.dev/shared/seqtamWuMXLwxJEAX1XNjwhzciAajw) as with [Plausible](https://plausible.ci.dev/ocaml.org). I also enabled the option `Discard client IP data`.

The OCaml website can be updated with [PR#3101](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/pull/3101).
