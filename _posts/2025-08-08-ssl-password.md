Would you like the maintainer's version of the file or the local one? It's one of those questions during `apt upgrade` that you answer on autopilot. Normally, it's  _local_ every time. Sometimes, the changes look mundane, and you take the _maintainer's_. I did that today on `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, but it made me pause and check whether password authentication had been inadvertently turned back on.

I could check the defaults for `sshd` and look at the values set in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` and any files in `/etc/ssh/ssh_config.d`, but it would surely be easier to try to log in remotely using a password by turning off public key authentication.

```bash
~$ ssh -o PreferredAuthentications=password -o PubkeyAuthentication=no username@hostname
username@hostname: Permission denied (publickey).
```

That machine looks secure. What about other machines? I have an Ansible inventory _hosts_ file, and an extensive history in my `~/.ssh/known_hosts`. I need an automated tool to check everything! [mtelvers/ssh-security-checker](https://github.com/mtelvers/ssh-security-checker) is that tool!

```bash
$ dune exec -- ssh-security-checker ./hosts
