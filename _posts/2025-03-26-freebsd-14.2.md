CI workers `spring` and `summer` run FreeBSD and need to be updated.

Check the current version of FreeBSD which we have with `uname -r`.

```
FreeBSD summer 14.1-RELEASE-p5 FreeBSD 14.1-RELEASE-p5 GENERIC amd64
```

Run `freebsd-update fetch` to download the latest versions of the system components, particularly the `freebsd-update` utility.  It even reported that it really is time to upgrade!

```sh
# freebsd-update fetch
...
WARNING: FreeBSD 14.1-RELEASE-p5 is approaching its End-of-Life date.
It is strongly recommended that you upgrade to a newer
release within the next 5 days.
```

Install these updates.

```sh
freebsd-update install
```

Now use `freebsd-update` to fetch the 14.2-RELEASE and install it.

```sh
# freebsd-update upgrade -r 14.2-RELEASE
...
#Â freebsd-update install
src component not installed, skipped
Installing updates...
Kernel updates have been installed.  Please reboot and run
'freebsd-update [options] install' again to finish installing updates.
```

Reboot the system using `reboot` and then finish installing updates.

```sh
# freebsd-update install
src component not installed, skipped

Now use `pkg` to upgrade any applications.

```sh
# pkg upgrade

Proceed with this action? [y/N]: y
```

Finally, reboot the system and check `uname -a`.

```sh
# uname -a
FreeBSD spring 14.2-RELEASE-p1 FreeBSD 14.2-RELEASE-p1 GENERIC amd64
```

To update the the FreeBSD base images used by the CI services, I applied [PR#13](https://github.com/ocurrent/freebsd-infra/pull/13) to [ocurrent/freebsd-infra](https://github.com/ocurrent/freebsd-infra).

This was followed up by [PR#1007](https://github.com/ocurrent/ocaml-ci/pull/1007) on ocurrent/ocaml-ci and [PR#427](https://github.com/ocurrent/opam-repo-ci/pull/427) to ocurrent/opam-repo-ci.
