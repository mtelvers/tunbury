The opam2web image for [opam.ocaml.org](https://opam.ocaml.org) is huge weighing in at more than 25 GB. The bulk of this data is opam archives, which are updated and copied into a stock caddy image.

There are two archives, `ocaml/opam.ocaml.org-legacy`, which hasn't changed for 5 years and holds the cache for opam 1.x and `ocaml/opam:archive`, which is updated weekly.

The current `Dockerfile` copies these files into a new layer each time opam2web builds.

```dockerfile
FROM --platform=linux/amd64 ocaml/opam:archive as opam-archive
FROM ocaml/opam.ocaml.org-legacy as opam-legacy
FROM alpine:3.20 as opam2web
...
COPY --from=opam-legacy . /www
...
RUN --mount=type=bind,target=/cache,from=opam-archive rsync -aH /cache/cache/ /www/cache/
...
```

And later, the entire `/www` structure is copied into a `caddy:2.8.4` image.

```dockerfile
FROM caddy:2.8.4
WORKDIR /srv
COPY --from=opam2web /www /usr/share/caddy
COPY Caddyfile /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
ENTRYPOINT ["caddy", "run", "--config", "/etc/caddy/Caddyfile", "--adapter", "caddyfile"]
```

This method is considered "best practice" when creating Docker images, but in this case, it produces a very large image, which takes a long time to deploy.

For Docker to use an existing layer, we need the final `FROM ...` to be the layer we want to use as the base. In the above snippet, the `caddy:2.8.4` layer will be the base layer and will be reused.

The archive, `ocaml/opam:archive`, is created by this Dockerfile, which ultimately uses `alpine:latest`.

```dockerfile
FROM ocaml/opam:archive AS opam-archive
FROM ocurrent/opam-staging@sha256:f921cd51dda91f61a52a2c26a8a188f8618a2838e521d3e4afa3ca1da637903e AS archive
WORKDIR /home/opam/opam-repository
RUN --mount=type=bind,target=/cache,from=opam-archive rsync -aH /cache/cache/ /home/opam/opam-repository/cache/
RUN opam admin cache --link=/home/opam/opam-repository/cache

FROM alpine:latest
COPY --chown=0:0 --from=archive [ "/home/opam/opam-repository/cache", "/cache" ]
```

In our opam2web build, we could use `FROM ocaml/opam:archive` and then `apk add caddy`, which would reuse the entire 15GB layer and add the few megabytes for `caddy`.

`ocaml/opam.ocaml.org-legacy` is another 8GB. This legacy data could be integrated by adding it to `ocaml/opam:archive` in a different directory to ensure compatibility with anyone else using this image. This is [PR#324](https://github.com/ocurrent/docker-base-images/pull/324)

```ocaml
 let install_package_archive opam_image =
   let open Dockerfile in
+  from ~alias:"opam-legacy" "ocaml/opam.ocaml.org-legacy" @@
   from ~alias:"opam-archive" "ocaml/opam:archive" @@
   from ~alias:"archive" opam_image @@
   workdir "/home/opam/opam-repository" @@
   run ~mounts:[mount_bind ~target:"/cache" ~from:"opam-archive" ()] "rsync -aH /cache/cache/ /home/opam/opam-repository/cache/" @@
   run "opam admin cache --link=/home/opam/opam-repository/cache" @@
   from "alpine:latest" @@

   copy ~chown:"0:0" ~from:"archive" ~src:["/home/opam/opam-repository/cache"] ~dst:"/cache" ()
```

Finally, we need to update [opam2web](https://github.com/ocaml-opam/opam2web) to use `ocaml/opam:archive` as the base layer rather than `caddy:2.8.4`, resulting in the final part of the `Dockerfile` looking like this.

```dockerfile
FROM ocaml/opam:archive
RUN apk add --update git curl rsync libstdc++ rdfind caddy
COPY --from=build-opam2web /opt/opam2web /usr/local
COPY --from=build-opam-doc /usr/bin/opam-dev /usr/local/bin/opam
COPY --from=build-opam-doc /opt/opam/doc /usr/local/share/opam2web/content/doc
COPY ext/key/opam-dev-team.pgp /www/opam-dev-pubkey.pgp
ADD bin/opam-web.sh /usr/local/bin
ARG DOMAIN=opam.ocaml.org
ARG OPAM_REPO_GIT_SHA=master
ARG BLOG_GIT_SHA=master
RUN echo ${OPAM_REPO_GIT_SHA} >> /www/opam_git_sha
RUN echo ${BLOG_GIT_SHA} >> /www/blog_git_sha
RUN /usr/local/bin/opam-web.sh ${DOMAIN} ${OPAM_REPO_GIT_SHA} ${BLOG_GIT_SHA}
WORKDIR /srv
COPY Caddyfile /etc/caddy/Caddyfile
ENTRYPOINT ["caddy", "run", "--config", "/etc/caddy/Caddyfile", "--adapter", "caddyfile"]
```

I acknowledge that this final image now contains some extra unneeded packages such as `git`, `curl`, etc, but this seems a minor inconvenience.

The `Caddyfile` can be adjusted to make everything still appear to be in the same place:

```
:80 {
	redir /install.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/opam/master/shell/install.sh
	redir /install.ps1 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ocaml/opam/master/shell/install.ps1

	@version_paths path /1.1/* /1.2.0/* /1.2.2/*
	handle @version_paths {
		root * /legacy
		file_server
	}

	handle /cache/* {
		root * /
		file_server
	}

	handle {
		root * /www
		file_server
	}
}
```

In this configuration, the Docker _push_ is only 650MB rather than 25GB.
