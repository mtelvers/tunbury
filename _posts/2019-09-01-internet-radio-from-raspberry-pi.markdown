Install the software packages needed

    sudo apt-get install libmp3lame0 libtwolame0
    sudo apt-get install darkice
    sudo apt-get install icecast2

During the installation you will be asked to set the icecast password which youâ€™ll need enter into the configuration file below

Check your recording device is present

    pi@raspberrypi:~ $ arecord -l
    **** List of CAPTURE Hardware Devices ****
    card 1: AK5371 [AK5371], device 0: USB Audio [USB Audio]
    Subdevices: 0/1
    Subdevice #0: subdevice #0

Try to make a recording:

    arecord -D plughw:1,0 temp.wav

If the volume is too quiet, you can adjust it with alsamixer -c 1 where 1 is your audio device. Note that 0 is the Raspberry PI default output device.

Create a configuration file for darkice

Invoke the server by running darkice at the prompt.

Set darkice to run at boot up

    update-rc.d darkice defaults
